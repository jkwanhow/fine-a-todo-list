# **still in progress** To Do List
 Bit late, but a todo list because I need to show projects.
 
 Feel like I don't have many projects, and I don't have many creative ideas, so decided to just make a to do list. Also using this experience to see how deployment works as well as practicing building tests.
 
running on development environment:
npm run dev

running test:
npm test
 
 current features:
 - add tasks via a popup (styling still in progress)
 - view tasks details
 - complete task
 - delete a task
 - edit a task

features to add:
- navbar for sections
- task sections
- task section progression display

not to add but need to change modify styling and organise strcuture better
